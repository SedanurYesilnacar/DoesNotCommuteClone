# 🚗 Does Not Commute Clone

A Unity-made clone of the brilliant game **Does Not Commute**, originally created by Mediocre. This is a strategic driving game where you must plan the routes of multiple vehicles on a small map — and every move affects the next.

> "What if time was not on your side... and neither were the other drivers?"

## 🎮 Gameplay

In this game, you control a series of cars, one at a time. Each car needs to reach its destination — but the twist is: all previous cars remain on the map and follow the paths you've already driven. As the level progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid collisions.

🧠 Think fast, plan carefully, and adapt to the chaos!
